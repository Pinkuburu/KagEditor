KagEditor
============

KagEditor is a dedicated tool for Kirikiri scripts (.ks files) with a proper GUI inspired from Office's ribbons. These scripts are used in text-based adventure games running on the Kirikiri Adventure Game (KAG) engine.

## Get Started

The main purpose of this tool is to facilitate the translation of KAG games, which are mostly in japanese. In this end, it support the following use case:

* JIS <-> UTF8 transcoding.
* Extract and re-import actual text from the script
* Manage word-wrapping that is not present by default (because japanese don't need it)

Specific implementation can vary between games.
